# THESIS_SYNC_AGENT

## Purpose
This document stores detailed notes and insights directly relevant to thesis work. Unlike PROGRESS_LOG.md (which tracks session-by-session development), this file is reserved for:
- Experiment results and performance data
- Validated behaviors and findings (e.g., "Tag hover + yaw-lock works reliably at X distance")
- Technical insights that should go into the thesis narrative
- Key papers, references, or design decisions that shaped the implementation
- Lessons learned and design trade-offs

**Add an entry here only when you have a concrete result, test outcome, or insight worth documenting for your thesis.**
